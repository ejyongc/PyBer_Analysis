## Overview of the Analysis-

In this analysis we are working with Pyber executives on combining two important datasets (city_data and ride_data). This new dataset allows us to segment important KPIs like *"Total Rides", "Total Drivers", Total Fares", "Average Fare per Ride", and "Average Fare per Driver"* for each city type.  The main outcomes of the Pyber Analysis is the *pyber_data_df* dataframe, and the *weekly_fares_graph* that give us a visual representation of how fares weekly fluctuate on each one of the three different market *types*. 


With this information at hand, Pyber executives could feel inclined to call their engineering team to review their algory

    Results:
        There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type. (7 pt)
        
##ADD GRAPH HERE##
In the first outcome of the Pyber Analysis we can identify some key differences between *Rural, Suburban,* and *Urban* city *types*. The first significant diffrences are the *Total Rides* and *Total Drivers*. Urban Drives are 2.16X the size of Suburban and Rural rides combined. Very similarly the total amount of drivers on a Urban City is 4.23X the size of Suburban and Rural cities combined. 
The significant differnce of *Total Rides* and *Total Drivers* amoing the city types leads to a high sum of *Total Fares* on Urban cities as well.  In this case, Urban cities generated +63% or $16k more in *Total Fares* than the Suburban and Rural city types combined.

We can see how how naturally more heavily populated cities can generate much higher revenues in terms of Fares, but we'd also wanted to consider other KPIs like *"Average Fare per Ride", and "Average Fare per Driver"* in order to identify opportunites on the way drives are geting compensated.

On our analysis we discovered that the *"Average Fare per Ride"* could flucuate between $4-$10 dollars depending on the city type. This could be explpained by idea that rides on rural cities are longer distances than those in Urban cities. 

An interesting observation we came across was the significant gap between *Rural* and *Urban* *"Averages Fare per Driver"*. This metric could raise the question that drives in *Rural* cities could be potentially generating more money than drivers in *Urban* cities. Although we don't know this for certain, we'd want to make sure drivers that chose to work for Pyber are fairly being compensated based on their work and now based on where they live. 


In this case we can see how a higher density of drivers on a city type can cause *Average Fare per Driver* to be decrease by almost -70%

    Summary:
        There is a statement summarizing three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types. (4 pt)
