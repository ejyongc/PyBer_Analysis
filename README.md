## Overview of the Analysis-

In this analysis we are working with Pyber executives on combining two important datasets (city_data and ride_data). This new dataset allows us to segment important KPIs like *"Total Rides", "Total Drivers", Total Fares", "Average Fare per Ride", and "Average Fare per Driver"* for each city type.  The main outcomes of the Pyber Analysis is the *pyber_data_df* dataframe, and the *weekly_fares_graph* that give us a visual representation of how fares weekly fluctuate on each one of the three different market *types*. 

With this information at hand, Pyber executives could feel inclined to call their engineering team to review their algory
